# Q6. Draw a flowchart to solve the following series S = x - x^3 + x^5 - x^7 ..... x^n

### Algorithm: Evaluate the series S = x - x^3 + x^5 - x^7 ..... x^n

Step 1: Read numbers x, n

Step 2: Set term = x, sum = 0

Step 3: Repeat for i = 0 to (n-1)/2 + 1

        sum = sum + term

        term = term * -x*x

Step 4: Display sum

Step 5: END ALGO
